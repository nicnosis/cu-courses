# Project Three --- <small>Houdini</small>
## Description
In this assignment, you will use Houdini to create an abstract piece that introduces randomization.

### Need inspiration?
This list is not exhaustive, but it's a good starting point. You are welcome to draw inspiration from everything (even if it's not related to art, graphics, design, etc.)

Remember: there is also the [inspiration](../inspiration.html) section of the site.

* [Behance search '3d abstract'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&search=3d%20abstract&sort=appreciations&time=week)
* [Behance search 'houdini'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&tools=28119&sort=featured_date&time=week)
* [Behance search 'sculpting'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&field=sculpting&sort=featured_date&time=week)
* [Behance search 'motion design'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&field=motion%20graphics&sort=featured_date&time=week)

## Requirements and Grading Considerations
This project is worth `20 pts.`

### VISION `9 pts.`
Message and Meaning
* Project conveys artistic ambition
* Project has a clear theme, purpose, vision, idea, statement, message, etc.
* Project is dynamic, captivating, noteworthy, thought-provoking, etc.

Aesthetic
* Project is pleasant and presentable. Should be usable as a portfolio piece.
* Project should be appealing as an abstract work
* Colors and visual effects should be harmonious and deliberate
* There is a sense of precision and care; effort is made to make sure shapes look good
* This might mean subdividing elements to smooth them out, add a smooth node... converting to VDB etc.

### RENDERING `5 pts.`
Renders:
* When you are ready to render, use `Render > Preview in MPlay`. Then you can save the frame from there.
* Optional: You can render it with Mantra, ROP, or some other method.
* Successfully render at least five frames (use `.png` please).
* Put them in the `render` folder.

Lighting:
* Contains environment lighting with an HDRI. You can get them from [HDRIHaven](https://hdrihaven.com/)
* __MAKE SURE YOUR HDRI FILE IS IN THE PROJECT FOLDER__

Materials:
* Geometry has some kind of material
* You can select a pre-made material such as principled shader from the `material palette` to add to your project.
* At the `obj` level you can select your geometry, go to `parameters` and set the material in the `render` tab.

### VARIATION `6 pts.`
Randomization:
* Project implements some form of randomization
* You may find [this article](https://houdinitricks.com/different-ways-to-randomize-scale-in-houdini/) useful. _(This is also a great way to add some VEX to your project)_
* Project should give me a way to experiment with variation. I recommend using a channel to do this (add one to your parameter interface). [Joy of Vex](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/the-joy-of-vex/) is useful.
* Scatter node is a good way to create variation.
* Switch node is also useful in introducing variation.

Loops:
* <s>You need some kind of loop</s> `EDIT: Loops are optional`.
* You can use the loop for __any reason__ but it shouldn't be for __no reason__.
* Excellent [loop tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ermCiovKIY&t=1098s) here.
* [Another one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs5WezgOZlo&list=PLluEQHH-SaesqNqByvAzI63_txp5n2lW6&index=8&t=0s)

### VEX (optional)
* (optional) Project can have some form of VEX code (it can even be one line of code)
* You may find [JoyOfVex](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/the-joy-of-vex/) useful.

## Submission
This time instead of just submitting the `.hipnc` file, you will submit the entire project folder, compressed as a `.zip` file.

1. Please make sure the `.hipnc` file is named `p3-lastname-firstname.hipnc`
2. Compress your Houdini project folder. Make sure all of the relevant assets (e.g. HDRI) are in the folder.
3. Make sure you have a `render` folder with your renderings in it.
4. Please make sure your `.zip` file is named `p3-lastname-firstname.zip`
5. Submit the `.zip` file to Moodle

### Due Date
This assignment is due __Friday Dec 15th @ 11:59pm__

Because the registrar has a deadline for course grade submissions, __I cannot accept late submissions for this project.__
