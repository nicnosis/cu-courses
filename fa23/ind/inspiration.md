# Inspiration
This collection of tools, links, and resources is meant to supplement your creative discovery process. However, none of these can replace genuine curiosity and interest, iteration, and ambition.

## Sources
You need to look at creative work every day. These are good starting places.

I'd recommend installing the [Muzli](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/muzli-2-stay-inspired/glcipcfhmopcgidicgdociohdoicpdfc?hl=en) Chrome Extension!

## A note
While this list is fairly exhaustive, I cannot understate the importance of exploring different sources and mediums.

* Can you get website ideas from reading a graphic novel?
* Can you get motion design ideas from birdwatching?
* Can you get visual style or branding ideas from watching a music video?

__Absolutely.__

Never limit yourself to conventional sources or immerse yourself in an echo chamber; the most novel ideas can manifest in unlikely places.
