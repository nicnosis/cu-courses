# COMM345: INFORMATION DESIGN
#### FALL 2023
**INSTRUCTOR** --- Nic Aguirre --- naguirre@clarkson.edu  
**OFFICE HOURS** --- Wed 3:00p -- 4:00p @ 164 Snell Hall

**CLASS LOCATION** --- CEC: 130 Snell Hall  
**SECTIONS**  
COMM 345-01
(10222) --- Meets Mon/Wed 11:00a -- 12:15p

## Objectives
In this course, you’ll learn methods for designing effective, information-based texts (often visual
but in some cases for other senses).

In this course, you'll learn to:

1. Analyze context, audience, and purpose for your design 
2. Select an appropriate format (such as type of chart) for information based on that analysis
3. Use software such as Excel, Tableau, and Illustrator for information design.

## Work
### Use of Class Time
This class is project-driven, and demands consistent effort inside and outside of the classroom. Classes are intended to be variable and may feature lectures, tutorials, in-class exercises, discussions and lab time. An effort is made to create a more interactive and less passive experience for students.

### Projects (60 pts.)
This class features four large-scale projects.

* Project 1 (10 pts.) 
* Project 2 (15 pts.)
* Project 3 (15 pts.)
* Project 4 (20 pts.)


### Homework (20 pts.)
This class has homework assignments designed to test and reinforce knowledge from class. Homework assignments typically involve a shorter or less involved task.

### Quizzes and Participation (15 pts.)
A quiz consists of either (a) an unannounced quiz or (b) an in-class lab activity. Quizzes are designed to ensure that students are completing their readings, preparing properly, and following along with in-class technical activities.

Participation is an important element of this class. Being present (physically and mentally) will give you a better experience.

Many of our classes will focus on the completion of certain exercises, tutorials, and discussions. Most class days will feature a small participation exercise. They are to be finished during class and are generally graded on completion.

Students __must be physically present__ to claim a participation assignment. Coming to class late, leaving early, or attempting to submit participation while not present are all grounds for losing points.

### Professionalism (5 pts.)
Students are expected to behave like adults. Unprofessional behavior will be met with a grade deduction in this category.

Unprofessional behavior includes (but is not limited to):

* Arriving to class late
* Leaving class early
* Failure to observe course policies
* Disrespect towards classmates or instructor
* Lack of consideration for classmates or instructor
* Distracting behavior
* Failure to practice academic integrity
* Excessive use of cell phone during class


### Final
There is no final exam for this class; you will present a final project instead.


## Grading
### Points

| B-    | < 83.0% to 80.0% |
| C+    | < 80.0% to 77.0% |
| C     | < 77.0% to 73.0% |
| C-    | < 73.0% to 70.0% |
| D+    | < 70.0% to 67.0% |
| D     | < 67.0% to 63.0% |
| D-    | < 63.0% to 60.0% |
| F     | < 60.0% to 0.0%  |



Grading criteria will be given for each individual assignment.

## Revisions
When software is created in a professional environment, changes and revisions are common. Factoring that software development is an iterative process, students are __sometimes__ allowed to revise and resubmit assignments. Re-submitting work is a __privilege__ granted at the instructor's discretion.

If you are re-submitting work:

1. You must have submitted the work by its due date. Late work is not eligible for re-submission.
2. The privilege to revise submitted work is only available for students who submitted substantial work; incomplete or dysfunctional work is not eligible for resubmission. This is at the instructor's discretion.
3. You may only recover partial points lost.

### Hardware
You need access to a high-performance computer. The CEC computers will work.

## Policies
### Attendance
Students should make a serious effort to attend every lecture. While attendance is not taken, I believe **attendance is the strongest guarantor of success** in this course.

Course material is cumulative in nature and class periods are used to develop skills and work on projects. You will also miss out on quizzes and participation activities if you miss class.

### Deadlines
Deadlines are strict and non-negotiable. Late assignments will be accepted for the first three calendar days after a deadline. I will remove 15% for each day past the deadline _(Example--- If you got 85 on an assignment but submitted it two days late, you're getting a 55)_.

Assignments may not be submitted after three calendar days have elapsed (Example--- Deadline is September 8th, you cannot submit after September 11th)

The only __exception to this rule__ is the final project, which cannot be submitted late.

### Absences
Whether or not an absence is excused is __entirely at the discretion of the instructor__.

If you miss a quiz or participation exercise and have an __excused absence__, you have __one week__ to make up that assignment at office hours. If you cannot attend scheduled office hours, it is your responsibility to reach out and schedule another meeting time.


If you know you are going to be absent or late on a certain day, please tell me ahead of time.

### Lost Data
You are responsible for keeping backups/duplicates of your files. You can use Google Drive or GitHub to maintain copies of your files. Losing your files is not an excuse for late or incomplete work.

### Email
When you e-mail me, **your subject line should include the course number and section** e.g.-- _"[COMM345 MW 11:00am]"_

Example of a poor email subject line: _"its not working"_

Example of a good email subject line: _"[COMM345 MW 11:00am] Custom fields in Tableau"_

If you need help with a project, you need to give me a way to access these files (e.g., GitHub repo, Google Drive shareable link)

__It can be difficult to diagnose technical problems via e-mail.__ I'll do my best, but you should consider talking with me after class, or coming to office hours if you're struggling with an assignment.

Students should know that an e-mail response may take __up to 72 hours__ depending on the time of the semester.

### Food and Drink in Class
Sorry, they are not permitted.

### Academic Integrity
Academic Integrity, based on the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility, is a fundamental principle of scholarship in higher education. Clarkson’s Academic Integrity Policy prohibits: plagiarism (using another person’s writing or copying any work without proper citation), falsification, unauthorized collaboration during a test or on an assignment, or substitution for another student to take an exam, course or test, and other forms of academic dishonesty.

If you are to benefit from this class and be properly evaluated for your contributions, it is important for you to be familiar with and follow [Clarkson University’s Academic Integrity policy](https://www.clarkson.edu/admissions-financial-aid/sas/clarkson-regulations). Please review this policy online (Undergraduate section IV – Academic Integrity, Graduate section IV – Academic Integrity). Work that violates this policy will not be tolerated. Students who are found responsible for a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy will have both a university process sanction and an academic outcome, that could include a failing grade on the assignment or exam, or a failing grade for the course.

#### Proper Attribution for Referenced Works
If you use others' work, you must:

1. Get my permission.
2. Cite your sources.

#### Using assets
Sometimes you'll want to use pre-existing assets--- 3D models, brushes, icons, scripts etc.

This is permitted as long as you:

1. Get my permission to use it in your project
2. Make sure that the assets are available for re-use (check the license!)
3. Make sure the creator is aware that their assets are being used

#### Generative AI
You can use generative AI.

However, there are several reasons you should approach it with caution:

1. Excessive use inhibits your ability to learn and memorize patterns independently
2. It can stifle human creativity
3. It is still prone to errors
4. It doesn't fully understand the context in which it is generating content

It is not acceptable to have a substantial amount of your work generated by AI.

Please refer to Clarkson Library’s [Guide to Plagiarism](https://sites.clarkson.edu/library/plagiarism/) and the [guide to Citing Sources](https://sites.clarkson.edu/library/citing-sources/) for assistance on avoiding plagiarism and properly citing sources.
