# Homework Two --- <small>Tableau Dashboard</small>
## Description
This assignment will give you hands-on experience in data visualization and analysis using Tableau. You will work a basic dataset of your choice.



## Process

### 1) Data Selection and Preparation
Consider your interests and research questions when making your selection. 

Import the selected dataset into Tableau.

#### Datasets
1. Option 1--- Pick a dataset from the [Fun, Beginner-Friendly Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rtatman/fun-beginner-friendly-datasets)
2. Option 2--- Use your own dataset. You might visit the [inspiration section](/inspiration.html) of the site and browse some of the datasets

### 2) Data Exploration and Visualization
First, explore the data in Google Sheets to get a feel for its shape, size, and variables.

Then, explore the data within Tableau to understand its structure, variables, and possible relationships.

Create a minimum of three different types of data visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, line charts) using the selected indicators. Each visualization should provide unique insights.

### 3) Interactivity and Filtering
Add interactivity to your visualizations.

Implement filters and actions to enable users to interact with the data.

This can be simple; don't overthink it.

### 4) Dashboard Design
Combine your visualizations into a single Tableau dashboard.

Consider the needs of your target audience (who's looking at the final product?).

### 5) Narrative and Interpretation
What story does the data tell?

Write a simple narrative that explains key findings and insights.

This you'll export as a `pdf` when you're done. Name it `hw2-lastname-firstname.pdf`.

## Submission
You need to submit two thingsâ€” your Tableau link and your written narrative.

1. In Tableau, do `Server > Tableau Public > Save to Tableau Public As` and publish it. Make sure it has your name clearly visible. PLEASE MAKE SURE THIS LINK IS ALSO IN YOUR PDF.
2. For your written narrative export a `pdf`. Name it `hw2-lastname-firstname.pdf`.

## Grade
This is worth `6 pts.`

Considerations:
* `data selection`: Pick a worthy subject of visualization.
* `filename` should be correct. All lowercase. No spaces or underscores
* Tableau viz contains at least one `dashboard`
* `narrative` has interesting analysis/takeaways
* Visualization has `interactivity and filtering` - This can be simple; don't overthink it.

#### Due Date
This is due `Monday Oct. 16th @ 11:59pm`.
