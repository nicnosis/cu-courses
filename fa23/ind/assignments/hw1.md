# Homework One --- <small>Big Idea</small>
## Description
In this assignment, you will analyze the context of a successful visualization using the 'Big Idea' framework from our textbook.

STEP ONE:
 * Find a good visualization. You can use any you want. You might consult the [inspiration section](inspiration.html) of this site.
 * A couple of recommendations:

1. [The OECD Better Life Index](https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/#/11111111111)
2. [A Disappearing Planet](https://projects.propublica.org/extinctions/)

STEP TWO:
 * Complete the [Big Idea](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WJDLkMVTxlDHyeGWzeKQmSiXdmlxQSAg/view?usp=drive_link) framework. You are going to imagine that you have created the visualization, and used this worksheet just before. You might not have clear answer to some of the questions; do your best to speculate or research if you can.
