——`participation`: Logo Design Process——

Please refer to last week's __Visual Identity Design Process__:
1. Define the Brand— Researching the brand's mission, values, and target audience.
2. Research and Inspiration— Studying competitors, brainstorming, and gathering design inspiration.
3. Create Design Elements— Designing the logo, selecting colors, fonts, imagery guidelines etc.

You will assume that part 1 is done (just use your imagination). Spend a few minutes on brainstorming and looking up other examples, then immediately start sketching out logos.

Please submit at least two logo concepts today. They can be sketchy/unrefined as this is still in the ideation phase.

You will submit your logo on the Slack thread (please make sure you put the names of everybody in your group).
