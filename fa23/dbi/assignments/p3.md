# Project Three --- Brand Launch
## Overview
You will combine all of your learnings to launch a brand.

Your brand should be:
* Driven by a strong concept
* Unique and differentiated

## Requirements
### Brand Selection
You are allowed to use anything for this brand; you can even build on some of your previous work if you like.


All work must be original for this class.

You are __not allowed__ to use an established brand. You must create a new one.

Here are some examples of what is not allowed:
1. Creating a website for your mom's flower shop and submitting it as your own
2. Submitting your sports team's instagram profile
3. Submitting anything that was already created

### Proposal
You will submit a proposal. You will present it in class.


### Format

## Progress Checks
You will have regular project checks throughout the semester.

Your preparedness and level of progress at each check will influence your `participation` score.

## Submission


### Grading
This is worth `22 pts.`

### Due Date
This assignment is due __Friday Dec 15th @ 11:59pm__

Because the registrar has a deadline for course grade submissions, __I cannot accept late submissions for this project.__
