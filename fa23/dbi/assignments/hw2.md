# Homework Two --- <small>Vector Graphic</small>
## Description
You will use Illustrator to produce a vector graphic.

I'm flexible about what you want to draw.

The idea is to make sure you have mastery of Illustrator basics. You must demonstrate understanding of:
* `vector graphics`
* `select tool`
* `pen tool`
* `shapes` and `shapebuilder tool`
* `layers` and `groups`

### Tutorials
I recommend starting with this video:
 * [Illustrator for Beginners: Get Started in 10 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NBKRywEbNs)

These two are also useful:
* [Create a Soda Can Vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4601QiodeJc)
* [Create a Banana Vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByGb36WzGgE)

If you're not sure what to make, just do the soda can.

Note that you may need to consult other tutorials for this. __You are in charge of doing the work to understand this software.__

If you feel that you need additional support for this assignment, __don't hesitate to ask__. I am very available to help with technical challenges as long as you aren't asking at the last minute.


## Grading
This is worth `6 pts.`

Grading considerations:
* You must demonstrate mastery of Illustrator basics as listed in the above section.
* Make sure your file is named correctly if you want to receive full credit.
* Your Illustrator file should have elements and layers named appropriately.
* Your lines should be clean - no crooked / unsightly lines.
* Effort: Slapping something together quickly in Illustrator is not acceptable.


## Submission
You will submit two files:
1. Your `.ai` Illustrator File. Please name it `hw2-lastname-firstname.ai`
2. A `.pdf` export of your drawing. Please name it `hw2-lastname-firstname.pdf`

Also:
* Make sure your filenames are __all lowercase with no spaces or underscores__.
